# Project Arkham: agents.md

## Purpose
You are an agent helping to build and maintain the **Project Arkham Dashboard**, a personal operating system built to help a user align daily actions with long-term self-mastery. The dashboard is designed with a Gotham-inspired, Batman-like aesthetic and integrates principles of habit tracking, discipline, reflection, and competition.

Your task is to execute changes and improvements as requested — while preserving a sleek, minimal, dark theme and functionality rooted in self-discipline, ritual, and competition.

## Principles to Follow

1. **Dark Aesthetic**
   - Black background, neon/subtle glow accents.
   - Gotham-coded UI: terminal-esque, clean typography (monospace or tactical serif), minimal distractions.

2. **Immersion Over Noise**
   - Don’t clutter with animations or widgets unless they serve clear purpose.
   - Everything should feel like it belongs in a command center.

3. **Speed of Input = Speed of Use**
   - Tasks should be easily added, tracked, and reviewed.
   - Prioritize frictionless interaction (e.g., one-click logs, enter-to-log text boxes).

4. **Rival Model: Aatir 2.0**
   - The user competes daily against an idealized version of themselves.
   - Progress views must include this comparison (randomized completion % or stat summaries).

5. **Modular, Not Monolithic**
   - Each page/component should work independently.
   - Allow easy expansion (e.g., Alfred bot, new habit types, archive pages).

6. **Self-Reflection First**
   - Pages must prompt the user to reflect, realign, or reset.
   - Include short quote rotations, focus-setting inputs, and evening debriefs.
