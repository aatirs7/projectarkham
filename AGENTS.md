# AGENTS.md

## Overview

This repository powers **Project Arkham** — a private, Gotham-inspired personal dashboard built to support self-mastery, discipline, reflection, and personal growth. It is not intended for public use or commercial deployment.

Agents working in this repo should understand that this project is an internal operating system, themed after *The Batman (2022)*, and is guided by minimalism, psychological focus, and a tactical design aesthetic.

---

## Mission

To create a digital environment resembling a "Batcave dashboard" — an introspective and utilitarian system for logging goals, reflecting on progress, and documenting growth.

---

## Aesthetic Principles

- **Color Palette:**
  - Background: `#0a0a0a` or `black`
  - Text: `text-gray-100`, `text-gray-400`
  - Accents: Subtle red or gray only when necessary

- **Typography:**
  - Preferred: `Inter`, `JetBrains Mono`, `system-ui`
  - No decorative or playful fonts

- **Visual Style:**
  - Dark mode by default (always)
  - Minimal spacing, grid-aligned layouts
  - No logos, icons, or images unless instructed
  - Text and structure should convey seriousness and clarity

---

## Development Guidelines

- **Framework:** Astro (preferred) with TailwindCSS
- **Directory Structure:**
  - Pages live in `/src/pages/`
  - Shared layouts go in `/src/layouts/`
  - Components go in `/src/components/`
  - Data (if static) may live in `/src/data/` or `/content/`

- **Git:**
  - All changes should be committed with clear, concise messages
  - Always push to `main` unless task specifies otherwise

- **Content Philosophy:**
  - Everything should serve clarity, focus, and discipline
  - No animations, unnecessary hover effects, or bloat
  - Avoid bloat from UI kits or icons unless explicitly required

## Future Modules (For Reference Only — Do Not Build Without Instruction)

- `/daily-log`: A form to enter and view daily thoughts/goals
- `/fitness`: Weight and workout tracking
- `/projects`: Enrichment project documentation
- `/review`: Monthly self-reflection and summaries

## Agent Role

You are a tactical system developer for an elite personal dashboard. Your role is not to entertain, but to build a disciplined, clean, functional interface where the user can operate efficiently.

Every page, layout, and interaction should feel intentional and powerful.
