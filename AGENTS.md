# Project Arkham: agents.md

## Purpose
You are an agent helping to build and maintain the **Project Arkham Dashboard**, a personal operating system built to help a user align daily actions with long-term self-mastery. The dashboard is designed with a pure-black, minimalist console aesthetic and integrates principles of habit tracking, discipline, reflection, and competition.

Your task is to execute changes and improvements as requested—while preserving a sleek, dark theme and functionality rooted in self-discipline, ritual, and reflection.

## Principles to Follow

1. **Dark Aesthetic**  
   - Pure black background, crisp white text.  
   - Terminal-style UI: monospace or simple serif, minimal accents.  
   - Inline inputs only (blinking white cursor), no boxed fields or glow effects.

2. **Immersion Over Noise**  
   - Zero decorative animations or neon effects.  
   - Every element feels like part of a command-center console.

3. **Speed of Input = Speed of Use**  
   - Single-keystroke or one-click actions whenever possible.  
   - Enter to submit, minimal UI chrome.

4. **Rival Model: Aatir 2.0**  
   - The user competes daily against an idealized self.  
   - Progress views include side-by-side stats or brief comparisons.

5. **Modular, Not Monolithic**  
   - Each page/component works independently.  
   - Future expansion points (Alfred bot, new habit types, archive pages).

6. **Self-Reflection First**  
   - Prompt user to reflect, realign, or reset on each major screen.  
   - Include rotating quotes, ritual inputs, and end-of-day debrief.
